The Ouroboros project is a decentralized packet network implementation
started by Sander Vrijders and Dimitri Staessens. It stems from our
deep interest in computer networks, trying to solve some long standing
problems in IP networks such as achieving clean fragmentation, routing
scalability, efficient congestion control and simple
multicast. Instead of trying to tackle these issues in isolation, we
subscribe to the view that the entire TCP/IP design is *fundamentally*
broken, and a holistic approach is needed to build efficient packet
networks.

In addition, a lot of the design is inspired by Edward Snowdens
revelations and his call to [drastically improve end-user security and
privacy](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/05/edward-snowdens-other-motive-for-leaking/370068/)
on the internet.

Yesterday there was a bit of an unexpected spike in interest in
Ouroboros following a [post on
HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22052416).  I'm really
humbled by the response and grateful to all the people that show
genuine interest in this project.

I fully understand that people would like to know a lot more details
about Ouroboros than the current site provides. It was the top
priority on the todo list, and this new interest gives me some
additional motivation to get to it. There's a lot to Ouroboros that's
not so trivial, which makes writing clear documentation a tricky
thing to do.

I will also tackle some of the questions from the HN in a series of
blog posts in the next few days, replacing the (very old and outdated)
FAQ section. I hope these will be useful.

Again thank you for your interest.

Sincerely,

Dimitri

### Get Ouroboros

**Packages:**

For ArchLinux users, the easiest way to try Ouroboros is via the [Arch
User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ouroboros-git/),
which will also install all dependencies.

**Source:**

You can clone the [repository](/cgit/ouroboros) over https or
git:

```bash
$ git clone https://ouroboros.rocks/git/ouroboros
$ git clone git://ouroboros.rocks/ouroboros
```

Or download a [snapshot](/cgit/ouroboros/) tarball and extract it.

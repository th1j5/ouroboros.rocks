{{% blocks/lead color="secondary" %}} Ouroboros is a <b>peer-to-peer
packet network prototype</b>. It unifies all packet communications
--whether it is two programs the same machine or two programs in
computers on different continents -- using a single abstraction, which
we call a <b>flow</b>. The Ouroboros architecture improves security,
privacy and efficiency through <b>simplicity</b>. It provides a very
<b>compact API</b> for writing distributed software and networked
application libraries, with support for
both <b>unicast</b> <b>multicast</b> communications. Being rebuilt
from the ground up, Ouroboros is not directly compatible with IP or
UNIX sockets, but it is
<b>interoperable with UDP/IP and Ethernet</b>.

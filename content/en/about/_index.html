<p class="lead mt-5">A decentralized packet network</p>

Ouroboros stems from our deep interest in computer networks, tackling
some long standing problems in TCP/IP networks such as achieving clean
fragmentation, routing scalability, efficient congestion control and
simple multicast. Instead of trying to tackle these issues in
isolation, we subscribe to the view that the entire TCP/IP design is
*fundamentally* broken, and a different approach is needed to build
efficient packet networks.

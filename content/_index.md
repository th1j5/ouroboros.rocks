Ouroboros is a __peer-to-peer transport network__ built on a new
__recursive network paradigm__ according to a __UNIX design
philosphy__. The aim is to provide a __secure__ and __private__
networking experience and __simplify writing distributed software__
and networking libraries. It provides a __very simple API__ for both
__unicast__ and __multicast__ communication.

Ouroboros has similar objectives as the [Invisible Internet
Project](https://geti2p.net/en/). Protocols have minimal design (a
router doesn't need a source address), and other information can be
__encrypted__.

Ouroboros was originally started at [imec](https://www.imec-int.com)
under its Future Internet research, and is [free
software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software).
We introduced the project at [FOSDEM 2018]
(https://www.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/ipc/).

This new website is still __under construction__.

Ouroboros is a __peer-to-peer transport network__ built on a new
__recursive network paradigm__ according to a __UNIX design
philosphy__. The aim is to provide a __secure__ and __private__
networking experience and to __simplify writing distributed software__
and networked application libraries. Ouroboros provides a __very
compact API__ for both __unicast__ and __multicast__
communication. All protocols carry minimal information in their
headers (to minimize potential attack vectors), with easy-to-enable
__encryption__.

Ouroboros was originally started at [imec](https://www.imec-int.com)
under its Future Internet research, and is [free
software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software).  We
introduced the project at [FOSDEM 2018]
(https://www.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/ipc/).

This new website is still __under construction__.

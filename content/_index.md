title: "A decentralized packet network"

Ouroboros is a decentralized packet network for POSIX operating
systems.

Ouroboros provides a simple and minimal API for synchronous and
asynchronous IPC. Ouroboros can use IP, Ethernet LLC, Ethernet DIX or
Ethernet PHY (using the experimental raptor NetFPGA implementation) at
the lowest layer.

The best place to start exploring Ouroboros is this introduction
presented at [FOSDEM
2018](https://www.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/ipc/).

This website is currently under construction and undergoing frequent
